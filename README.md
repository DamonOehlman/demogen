# demogen

Demogen is the ___write your JS library demo code once___ solution.  

## Why use demogen?

It's annoying to wrap demos for your library in the same boilerplate HTML everytime, but that is the way that most of us like to consume demos.  I've made various attempts to make my demo writing process simple (for me) in the past but it generally results in demos that are confusing to work with.
